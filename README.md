# misc-javafx-samples

Some JavaFX code samples/examples I was experimenting with in high school, mostly here for archival purposes. I doubt any of these actually did much.

If for some reason you want to build or run any of them, I was using the NetBeans IDE at the time. Other than that I don't remember the build process.
I imagine you could run them from the command line like 

```
javac --module-path $PATH_TO_JAVAFX_INSTALLATION --add-modules javafx.<some modules> <class name>.java
java --module-path $PATH_TO_JAVAFX_INSTALLATION --add-modules javafx.<some modules> <class name>
```

I have no idea what modules need to be added to the build if your JDK is newer than 8. Java 8 was the hot new release the last time I touched any of this
